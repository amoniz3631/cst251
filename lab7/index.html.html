		<h1>Lab 7 Intro To CSS</h1>
	</center>
		<p> The idea of Lab 7 was to learn how to design our css pages to make background colors and other decorations to our page. .</p>
		<h2>Challenges</h2>
			<p>This lab was fairly simple. I didn't really have any issues.  </p>
		<h2>Results</h2>
			<p> Everything was working the way it was supposed to. My homepage is starting to come together and have a little more structure to it.</p>
