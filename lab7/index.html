		<h1>Challenges</h1>
		<p class="dotted">I was having challenges trying to make a border for all the content of this page.
		I was trying to change my css and it seems like a lot of it wasnt showing up and im not really sure why.</p>
		<h1>Problems</h1>
		<p class="dotted">My problems were mainly trying to style the sheet and get everything
		to show up on my browser. Some things I wasn't linking properly between the html and css
		so I'm not really sure what is going on there. </p>
		<h1>Results</h1>
		<p class="dotted"> This lab was really difficult I need
		a lot more practice!</p>
