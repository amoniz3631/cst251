		<h3> ARIANA SOUSA MONIZ </h3>
		<p>Hi! My name is Ariana and I don't really like coding. I'm a Sohpmore at CSUMB and my major is Communication Design. </p>
		<p> I have a huge passion for art and design. My favorite medium is acrylic, but I am trying to get into digital art! </p>
		<p>I have a dog her name is Lilac, she pretty neat. She's a husky blue queensland mix. She's the biggest ball of energy ever! </p>
		<p>Lilac probably runs my life, even though shes a dog she gets a good 80% of my attention. </p>
