	<h1>Lab 4 More Complicated HTML</h1>
		<p> The idea of Lab 4 was to learn how to attach links to our homepage and attatch links to images as well.</p>
	<h2>Challenges<h2>
		<p>I  felt like this lab went really smooth. The only issue I really had was the images. Which has been a reaccuring problem for me. </p>
	<h2>Results</h2>
	<p> Everything was working the way it was supposed to. I wish it was more pleasing to the eye though.</p>
