	<h1>Lab 5 More Complicated HTML</h1>
		<p> The idea of Lab 4 was to learn how to attach links to our homepage and attatch links to images as well.</p>
	<h2>Challenges<h2>
		<p>I  felt like this lab went really smooth. The only issue I really had was the images. Which has been a reaccuring problem for me. </p>
	<h2>Results</h2>
	<p> Everything was working the way it was supposed to. My homepage is starting to come together and have a little more structure to it.</p>
