		<h1>Challenges</h1>
		<p class="dotted">I was having challenges trying to make a border for all the content of this page.
		I was only able to create a border for the image and text.</p>
		<h1>Problems</h1>
		<p class="dotted">My problems were mainly trying to style the sheet and get everything
		to show up on my browser. Some things I wasn't linking properly between the html and css
		so I had to go in there and correct that </p>
		<h1>Results</h1>
		<p class="dotted">I enjoyed this lab for the most part. I feel like I need to spend
		more time actually coding and try not to take short cuts because I notice that I need
		a lot more practice!</p>
