			<h1> Lab 13: Typography </h1>
			<p> The idea of this lab is to practice Typography by taking a website and making a fake version of it use the elements that we have already learned. </p>
		<h1>Challenges</h1>
		<p> The biggest challenge I experinced in this lab is doing this all on my own. It has been extremely difficult to teach myself the content inside the lab. I was really hard to match the picture myself as well. </p>
		<h1>Problems</h1>
		<p>I feel like I really struggled with this lab just because it give you a lot of creative freedom and there are still some things I'm not solid on doing myself just yet. </p>
		<h1>Results</h1>
		<p> I think I managed to kinda copy the photo. Its definetly not exact or perfect in anyway but you can see what I was going for. </p>
