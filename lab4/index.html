	<h1>Lab 4 File Transfer</h1>
		<p> The idea of Lab 4 was to better strengthen the ideas we have already learned and show us how to push a new index to our main website. </p>
		<p> I like to think of this lab as a strengthening tool. We know how to do this, let just commit it to our brains and make it solid.</p>
	<h2>Challenges<h2>
		<p> I found that once I had spoken with Mariana, I realized that I really am working hard at this and trying my best to understand.</p>
		<p> I really would love for things to look a little neater and for my pictures to show up correctly. We tried a lot of different things. </p>
		<p> However, nothing seemed to be working out.</p>
	<h2>Results</h2>
		<p> Everything was working the way it was supposed to. I wish it was more pleasing to the eye though.</p>
