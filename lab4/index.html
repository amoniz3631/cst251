	<h1>Lab 4 File Transfer</h1>
		<p> The idea of Lab 4 was to better develop .</p>
	<h2>Challenges<h2>
			<p2> Even though Brooke helped me through 90% of the lab I felt like I eventually kind of understood what we were trying to do.
				It was hard since I didn't have a good computer from the beginning, I feel like I'm catching up and trying to work through it alone.</p>
	<h2>Results</h2>
	<p> Everything was working the way it was supposed to. I wish it was more pleasing to the eye though.</p>
