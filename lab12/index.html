			<h1> Lab 12: Advanced Block-Level styling II </h1>
			<p> The idea of this lab is to play around with different styling blocks. Such as aligning them, centering them, ect. </p>
		<h1>Challenges</h1>
		<p> The HTML for this was really hard. Especially since I'm pretty much doing this on my own. I have to kinda learn it on my own and don't really have a partner
		to fall back on. </p>
		<h1>Problems</h1>
		<p> For some reason my div wasn't working, but after I kept messing with it and	moving some stuff around it kinda snapped into place. It's a lot of trial and error. </p>
		<h1>Results</h1>
		<p> I thiiiiink it's okay. I fixed a couple things and tried my best not to give up on it this has been a very difficult year for me. I'm not this kinda of student </p>
